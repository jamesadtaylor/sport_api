## The How
This is a basic RESTFUL API developed in Python using the Flask framework. 
It utilises one GET endpoint from the the sportsdb API (https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php), translates the response and then makes 
it available as a JSON payload. Basic swagger documentation has been incorporated, but this needs to be enhanced as it is currently not useful.

## Running Instructions
1. Activate Virtual Environment
2. Run main.py
